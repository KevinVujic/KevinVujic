ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KevinVujic,

I'm a Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer who is interested in large scaling enterprise systems, software architecture and the cloud. I worked on 
numerous systems for public and private companies such as Volkswagen AG and THI Holdings GmbH. During my professional time I was able to work on projects from start 
to finish, including requirements analysis, system (-architecture) design, implementation, systematical testing (E2E-Tests) and deployment (CI/CD).

I'm currently learning migration, deployment and maintaining of cloud systems. Moreover, I am always interested in choosing the right technology for the right task, or in other words
the "right horse for the right race". This includes choosing the right database for your solution as well as the most appropriate system architecture to allow for scaling, maintainability
and the most intuitive production of new features!

I'm also looking into 3D-Design and Game Engines using Blender, Unity and/or Unreal. I think by making use of both worlds we can write solutions that are easy to use, reliable
 and most importantly fun to use!
 
 I'm looking to collaborate on fun projects that will help society and people in general. Right now I'm looking into A.I. aided drones with discoverability and recognization features
 so that we can make use of drones to check dangerous places (e.g. electricity lines) for damage instead of actual people.
 
 Contact me! I'm always interested in hearing about new projects and ideas! :)
